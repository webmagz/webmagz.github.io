Software design is often thought of as a technical process focused on coding and programming languages. However, the truth is that software design is all about thinking. The ability to think critically, creatively, and strategically is crucial for creating effective and efficient software.

Rich Hickey even suggested that we all step away from the computer and think about the problem for hours, days, or months in order to solve it. You can watch the presentation here https://youtu.be/f84n5oFoZBc .

The first step in software design is understanding the problem that needs to be solved. This requires critical thinking skills to analyze the problem, identify its root causes, and determine the best course of action. Without this step, software development can become a never-ending cycle of fixing bugs and adding new features without ever truly addressing the underlying issue.

Once the problem is understood, the next step is to come up with a solution. This requires creativity and the ability to think outside the box. Developers must be able to generate multiple ideas and evaluate their potential impact and feasibility. Without this step, the solution may be too simplistic or not fully address the problem at hand.

Finally, software design requires strategic thinking to plan and organize the development process. This includes determining the best approach to development, allocating resources, and managing timelines. Without this step, the development process can become disorganized and inefficient, leading to delays and increased costs.

In summary, software design is not just about coding and programming languages; it is about thinking. Critical thinking, creativity, and strategic thinking are essential for creating effective and efficient software. Developers who possess these skills are better equipped to solve problems and deliver high-quality solutions.
