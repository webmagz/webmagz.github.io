### Introduction

Before we get started, I would like to make it very clear that this article is not against copying and pasting code from other websites, like StackOverflow or any other site. I copy code all the time and use it in my codebase. This blog is the result of my recent experience with intentional learning through hand-typing code.

Have you ever wondered how you can learn something and keep it in your memory or learn new tech faster? In the last few months, I realized this while I was learning Python. I never coded in python and overall syntax was pretty much new to me. Python is a simple language, but it could be cumbersome for a new developer. Although I was experienced in another language, the first few days were overwhelming. I had to use Google or StackOverflow to find an answer every time I got stuck with syntax. This approach slowed me down drastically because every 10 min I was looking at StackOverflow or googling something.

To solve this problem, I promised myself to write code by hand irrespective of the time and effort to type it. I started trying this in other areas of learning too and the results were astonishing. I wish I could have done it earlier.

In this blog post, we'll explore the benefits of why writing code by hand is a better approach and why you should consider giving it a try:

### Improved Understanding of Syntax

Writing code by hand forces you to pay close attention to the syntax and structure of the language you're learning. This can help you develop a better understanding of how different elements of the language work together, which can, in turn, make it easier to write and read code.

### Greater Attention to Detail

When you're typing code into an editor, it's easy to make small mistakes that can have big consequences. When you write code by hand, you're more likely to catch these mistakes before they become a problem. This is because you're forced to slow down and pay attention to the details of each line of code.

### Enhanced Problem-Solving Skills

Writing code by hand can also help you to develop better problem-solving skills. When you're writing code, you're constantly trying to figure out how to make the computer do what you want it to do. By forcing yourself to think through each step of the process, you'll develop the ability to think critically and creatively about how to solve problems.

### Better Memory Retention

Writing code by hand is also a good way to help you remember what you've learned. When you type code into an editor, it's easy to forget what you did after you've moved on to other things. But when you write code by hand, you're more likely to remember what you did, which can make it easier to come back to the code later.

### A sense of ownership and responsibility over the code

When writing code by hand, you are more likely to understand the code and make modifications when needed. By having a sense of ownership and responsibility, you will also be more motivated to debug the code and fix it.

In conclusion, writing code by hand can be a great way to improve your understanding of a programming language, enhance your problem-solving skills, and develop better memory retention. It can also be a great way to get a sense of ownership and responsibility over the code. While it may seem old-fashioned in today's digital age, taking the time to write code by hand can be an effective way to learn how to code and set yourself up for success as a programmer.
