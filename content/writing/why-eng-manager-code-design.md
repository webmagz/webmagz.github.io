### I. Introduction

Being an engineering manager is a challenging task, and it requires a lot of skills and knowledge. But, if there's one thing that can give you a competitive edge, it's having a strong understanding of both design and coding. Not only will this help you lead your team more effectively, but it'll also give you the tools you need to make smarter decisions and deliver projects that will knock your clients' socks off.

### II. Understanding the Technical Aspects of a Project

Design is the process of creating a plan or blueprint for a product or system, while coding is the process of implementing that design using code. As an engineering manager, knowing both design and coding is like having a secret superpower. You'll be able to anticipate and solve problems that may arise during the development process, saving time and resources. And, let's be real, who doesn't want to be a superhero?

## III. Communicating with the Team

Engineers often speak in technical terms and having a shared understanding of the language and concepts used in the project can help you understand what your team is working on and how you can support them. This can lead to a more cohesive and productive team, because everyone is on the same page, and you'll be able to speak their language.

## IV. Mentoring and Coaching

Being able to design and code also allows managers to serve as mentors and coaches for their team members. You'll be able to provide guidance and advice on how to approach a task or problem and help your team members to develop their skills and abilities. This can lead to a more skilled and capable team, which is essential for delivering successful projects. Plus, you'll be the cool boss that everyone wants to learn from.

## V. Conclusion

In conclusion, engineering managers must have a solid understanding of both design and coding. Not only does this give them a better grasp of the projects and tasks they're overseeing, but it also allows them to better communicate with and lead their team. Additionally, knowing design and coding allows managers to anticipate and solve problems, serve as mentors and coaches for their team members, and deliver successful projects. So, if you're an engineering manager, make sure to invest time and effort in developing your design and coding skills, and take your skills to the next level.
